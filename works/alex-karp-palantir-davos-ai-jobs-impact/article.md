# Alex Karp on How AI Will Impact Jobs

## The Western Narrative on AI and Jobs

**Interviewer:** Is AI going to create jobs or destroy jobs overall?

**Alex Karp:** I think one of the unfortunate things of the narrative in the west is that *"it will destroy humanity's jobs"* — like, you know, you went to an elite school and you studied philosophy. Use myself as an example.

**Interviewer:** I did too.

**Karp:** Yeah. Hopefully you have some other skill. That one is going to be hard to market. And it was thought to be hard to market.

**Interviewer:** It was hard to market. Very hard. It was a good education.

**Karp:** A very, very strong education. If you can get a job, you might keep it. But that's what I always thought — *if I finally get a job, I'll probably keep it and do well, but I'm not sure who's going to give me my first job.*

## The Rise of Vocational Work

But like **technicians** — yeah, if you're a **vocational technician** or like we're building batteries for a battery company and the people who are doing it in America are doing roughly the same job that Japanese engineers are doing and they went to high school — now they're very valuable if not **irreplaceable** because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly, and those jobs are going to become more valuable.

I mean, not to diverge into my usual political screeds, but there will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with **vocational training**. I do think these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill.

## White Collar vs. Vocational Workforce

**Interviewer:** The foundation for white collar work in Europe and the United States has been through the universities, but I just heard you say we're going to need more vocational men and women. Are you also insinuating we're probably going to need less white collar?

**Karp:** Yes, but I think what we need to do is have **different ways of testing aptitude**. You know, there are a lot of people doing X that should be doing Y.

Like, the person managing our **Maven system** in the US Army is a former police officer who I think went to a junior college, and they're doing very, very high-end, very complicated targeting globally — and that person is actually **irreplaceable**. In the past, the way we tested for aptitude would not have fully exposed how irreplaceable that person's talents are. And would they have been as talented if they had not gone to their college? Yes.

## Finding Outlier Aptitude

I tend to — even inside **Palantir** — if you look at what am I really doing all day? I'm walking around figuring out *what is someone's outlier aptitude*, and then I'm putting them on that thing and trying to get them to stay on that thing and not on the five other things they think they're great at.

It's like, well, you know, every engineer at Palantir — for maybe 18 years everyone thought we were like a business joke, and now lots of business people want my advice. The only people who don't want my advice at Palantir about business are Palantir engineers. They're like, *"Hey Alex, I have an idea about how we could just be in a much better company"* — and it's always like McDonald's, but *"we should have some titles and you should stop speaking in public."*

And yeah, they're probably right about speaking in public sometimes. I certainly admit that.

**Interviewer:** I don't think you did anything wrong today.

**Karp:** Thank you for that high praise. One of the keys to success is **setting the bar very low**.

## The AI Divide: Developed vs. Developing Economies

**Interviewer:** Where will the curve of AI go in utilization in the United States and other developed economies? What about the developing economies? How can they participate in this? I read a research report that said the application of AI has been so dominant by societies of high education, and they're seeing a very big divergence that is occurring already. Is AI going to create a greater imbalance in our world in terms of growth?

**Karp:** Well, I think the obvious first imbalance is it seems like **America and China** understand versions of making this work — and they're different, but they both work and they work at scale. I think that is very likely to accelerate way beyond what most people believe is possible.

The **discount rate**, I think — not in the short term but in the long term — is way too high on what will be done and how this will impact every aspect of our society, especially on **military**.

I tend to be a realist: you have wide divergences, it's going to be hard to have the kind of discussions people want to have where two countries — and maybe a third following in Russia — because they're so good at fighting.

## Europe's Structural Problem

I spent a lot of my life, my most important years — my father's family came from a part of Germany. I really care about Europe, especially the German parts of Europe where I had many of my best years. I still fantasize about going back to grad school, not for the learning reasons.

**Interviewer:** You going to have more fun?

**Karp:** I had so much fun. We won't go into that. But it's like endless — I sometimes when I'm traveling across the country, I just think of grad school.

But the **tech adoption in Europe is a serious and very structural problem**. And what scares me the most is *I haven't seen any political leader just stand up and say we have a serious and structural problem that we are going to fix.*

---

## The Developing World: Pockets of Success and Failure

So then you get to the developing world. It depends what you mean by the developing world. I would imagine with not enough knowledge, you're just going to find **pockets that go very well and pockets that go very poorly**.

One way to look at the unfairness of AI is it **"pentests"** — meaning it **loadbears** on things. Societies, organizations, and companies that can bear that load have a huge advantage. The problem is if you've been pretending you're bearing a load you're not — it collapses, and that's where you have to start.

If you go around and just say, *"Okay, what societies and micro cultures are going to be loadbearing here?"* — I think you would find that parts of the developing world, certain communities, are going to do very well. You do need a **realistic assessment of the loadbearing**.

---

## The Painful Honesty of AI

There's a certain honesty that is painful for all of us in this technology. Large language models, however implemented in software — **you just cannot obfuscate what can bear the load and what can't**. And political structures are built to do just that.

Like, *"Yeah, I can't fix anything, but I can give you some line that you want to hear that's going to make you not care about how bad your life is and how much worse it's going to be tomorrow. I can give you that for free."*

And that stuff is harder to get away with in this culture.

## A Progressive's Call to Action

I still view myself as a **card-carrying progressive**. And I think the single most important thing a progressive could do is go around and say:

> *"Yeah, but the revolution that's coming is going to expose the actual market value of what you're doing, whether we want it or not."*

Like, I don't even want to know the market value of some of this stuff. But over a relatively rapid period of time — the **next three years** — you're just going to get **market value honesty** in all sorts of character and communities and micro communities.

The best thing you can do if you are in a community — whether that is a large community like Germany or a larger community like America — and you really care for the people you're representing, is to say: *"Yeah, but let's look closely at what load we can bear."*

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Alex.

**Karp:** Thank you, everyone.

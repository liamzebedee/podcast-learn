# What Most People Misunderstand About the Collapse of the Rules-Based Order

**Featuring Michael Every, Global Strategist at Rabo Bank**
*A conversation with Brent Johnson*

---

## Introduction

*"There are decades when nothing happens, and then there are weeks when decades happen."* — Vladimir Lenin

*"If you want to understand the future, look to the past."* — Albert Einstein

These two famous quotes perfectly sum up the conversation between Brent Johnson and Michael Every. Through his framework of **economic statecraft**—or in more flowery terms, **grand macro strategy**—Every has more accurately called where the world is headed, starting 10 years ago to where it is now, than perhaps anyone else in the field.

Michael Every is a global strategist at Rabo Bank in Singapore. He has lived and worked all over the world and has real-world, boots-on-the-ground experience in many different countries and cultures. His role is cross-asset, cross-geography, and cross-disciplinary. As he puts it: *"What I try and do is capture the zeitgeist, the big picture, and point out uncomfortable truths if trends continue. So if I spot something going 2, 4, 8, 16 and I know the world blows up at 32, I'm waving my hand, raising my arm, trying to point that out."*

## From Economic Policy to Economic Statecraft

The key shift happening right now is the move from **economic policy** to **economic statecraft**. As Every explains:

*"The key difference between policy and statecraft is with statecraft you combine all of them together—like fingers and a thumb into a fist. And it can be offensive or defensive, but you're doing it with a purpose."*

The fundamental question that drives this framework: **"What is GDP for?"**

Once you start answering that question, how you do everything else becomes obvious. You have to do X, Y, Z regardless of what the rules say or markets say. Until you ask yourself that question, you don't join anything up, and nothing you're doing has any strategic sense.

*"We're now in a world of economic statecraft, and in fact we're moving rapidly along the spectrum—from defensive to offensive—and into whole new isms like neoimperialism."*

## The Collapse of the Liberal World Order ≠ The Collapse of America

A critical misunderstanding that persists: many people equate the collapse of the liberal world order with the collapse of the United States. They see this as an event that will usher in the fall of the United States as the global hegemon and the rise of China, the Global South, or BRICS.

But this misses the point entirely.

*"The US is the one who built the liberal world order. America imposed it, collaborated to build it with others. Once you take that away, America is free to—okay, lose influence in some respects. You take the gloves off, people see you for who you really are. But Machiavelli said, 'Is it better to be loved or feared?' And it's better to be feared if you have to choose."*

The evidence is clear in recent events:
- **Venezuela**: The Monroe Doctrine is back in effect—America staking claim to Latin America and the Western Hemisphere
- **Middle East**: Iran's regime could fall, dramatically improving America's geopolitical position
- **Ukraine**: The ball has been handed to Europe with a clear message: *"Yours, and you need to copy our economic model to succeed"*

## Prioritization vs. Abandonment

A key insight from Michael J. McNair's review of the National Security Strategy document: *"The confusion comes from mistaking prioritization for abandonment."*

This is not the US pulling back because it has been defeated. This is strategic refocusing. Coming back to strengthen your own backyard allows you to force-project to an even greater extent when needed.

Consider: The US flew a bombing mission through Iranian airspace unopposed, from the other side of the world, and came home with no lives lost. The idea that Donald Trump wants to retreat from the global stage is, as Johnson puts it, *"about as silly a notion as I can imagine."*

## Spheres of Influence and the Great Game

The people who understand the Monroe Doctrine now say, *"Yeah, but the other part of the plan is he's going to give Europe and Ukraine to Russia and give all of Asia to China."*

**That's not how spheres of influence work.**

Every uses the analogy of the board game Risk: *"You hold your territory and then you hold the borders of the other continent so that they don't have the set and get more powerful."*

You don't let Asia fall to China because that would make them more powerful than you. Rich as the Americas are, Asia is more populous and could do far better—particularly given China's massive industrial head start. America has decades of catching up to do.

The strategy is clear:
- Don't allow a **Eurasian bloc** that could threaten America across the Atlantic
- Want Europe to step up and actually be prepared to fight Russia if necessary
- Currently, European defense capabilities are *"basically like a wet paper bag—anything you put in just falls out the bottom"*

## Defense Spending: The Numbers

Trump has suggested increasing the defense budget from just under $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion per year.

To put this in perspective: At the height of QE, the Fed was doing about $150 billion per month—roughly $1.5-2 trillion per year. But that money went to banks who then had to take a second step to provide new credit.

**This is different.** Defense spending goes directly into the economy immediately. There's no second step. This is not the United States rolling over to become a second-class citizen on the world stage.

## Reverse Perestroika: The Historical Parallel

Every draws a surprising parallel between Trump and **Mikhail Gorbachev**:

Gorbachev inherited a superpower in 1985 that was completely stagnant. The Soviet Union was fantastic at producing military goods but terrible at producing consumer goods. They could flood the world with Kalashnikovs, cheap tanks, and reasonable fighter jets, and they controlled around a third of the world's population.

The Communist Party appointed Gorbachev because they recognized they needed reform—to move toward embracing consumer goods alongside military goods. But the system couldn't be reformed. Partial reforms didn't work. Acceleration led to collapse.

**Trump is attempting the reverse.**

- Gorbachev: Command economy → Market economy (failed)
- Trump: Consumer economy → More command/military economy (attempting)

*"He's trying to take a US economy which is all about consumption and make it more about the military. It's reverse perestroika."*

The parallel extends further:
- **Glasnost** (radical transparency) → Trump's push for freedom of speech, even if offensive
- **Perestroika** (reforms) → Trump's economic restructuring

The risk: *"If he does get it wrong, we can see that obviously people would like to get rid of Trump... and things can fall apart."*

## The Monroe Doctrine and Latin America

The National Security Strategy makes something very clear: America wants **cheap commodities from Latin America** as part of a **reindustrialization of Latin America in parallel with reindustrialization of America**.

This aligns with Adam Smith's and David Ricardo's original concepts: you industrialize in your own economy and trade at the margin. You don't invest all your capital in a cheap country, produce everything there, and then borrow from them to buy their goods.

*"What they want actually is an inclusive, more fair, more equitable imperialism, if you will, which demolishes the neoliberal-based order. It's genuinely revolutionary in a way that transcends left and right traditions of the past 45 years."*

## Manufacturing Renaissance and Innovation

Many dismiss America's reindustrialization prospects, saying it will take 10-15 years and inflation will prevent success. But this assumes manufacturing will look the same as it did for the last 50 years.

With AI, 3D printing, and other innovations, manufacturing may look completely different. The United States still has, in Johnson's opinion, *"the greatest entrepreneurs and innovators in the world."*

If reindustrialization is coupled with innovation and partnerships in Latin and South America—especially with a war-based initiative to get it done—it may not take as long as conventional wisdom suggests.

## The Office of Strategic Capital

A small but extremely powerful department within the Department of Defense: the **Office of Strategic Capital**.

This will act as the quarterback to coordinate resources across public and private sectors, funding companies and industries deemed critical to national security and economic renaissance. Key facts:

- Not a typical government spending program
- Partners with private capital through matching funds and preferential financing
- Run by **Steve Feinberg**, founder and chairman of Cerberus, one of the most successful private equity firms in history
- Initial estimates of $200 billion in leverage capacity—and that was *before* the defense budget increase proposal

Every adds context: *"If you think the private sector doesn't misallocate capital, you've never worked in the private sector."* The only difference is the bankruptcy system traditionally wiped those companies out. If government can be efficient and have accountability mechanisms, it can work just as well.

China proves the point: 25 years of combining market forces with a command economy. They have problems now, but they're still here and can outproduce America **250 to 1 in shipbuilding**.

## The Fed as Battleground

*"If one can't see that the Fed is a battleground here after the headlines of the past few days, you're in the wrong job. Seriously. This is what it's all about and it will change the whole political economy of the US and the global system."*

Once you ask "What is GDP for?" you start asking "What's the Fed for?" And then "Who are interest rates for?" Control the Fed, and all things become possible for reverse perestroika.

## Venezuela, Greenland, and the Energy Game

The conversation shifts to **strategic geography** and **energy**:

**Venezuela** isn't just about oil for America. Even if the US never sells a barrel of Venezuelan oil, keeping it from China is the point. It's **physical censorship**—keeping a competitor from accessing resources.

The same applies to **Iran**. If both fall into disarray, two of China's biggest energy sources would be disrupted.

**Greenland** offers another strategic angle: its geostationary location is ideal for space-based solar panels—a path to infinite cheap power. Venezuela similarly offers equatorial advantages for space launches.

Both teams in this great game want **low prices for what they need** and **high prices for the other team**. A bifurcation of global commodity streams is coming that people aren't factoring in yet.

## Letters of Marque

Several years ago, Every predicted that **letters of marque** would return as a real thing. Last popular 200-300 years ago, these are provisions in the US Constitution allowing Congress to effectively legalize piracy—incentivizing the private sector to do what the navy isn't capable of doing.

Two months ago, this was actually floated as an idea regarding drug boats from South America. The prediction is entering the Overton window.

*"If you need to get something done geopolitically when you don't have the state's capacity to do it, but the private sector can more efficiently motivate itself and militarize itself to a degree—why wouldn't you do that?"*

## Surprises and Fractal Fractures

**What surprised Every most in the past year:** The rapid emergence of the "Groyper" phenomenon within MAGA—a more extreme far-right iteration that appeared faster than expected. The political coalition fracturing could affect 2026 midterms and 2028 elections.

Johnson's **"fractal fractures"** concept: Everywhere you look—domestically and internationally, across institutions and groupings—you see fractures. Each small fracture is a fractal of a bigger fracture, which is itself a fractal of an even bigger one.

**What surprised Johnson:** Not that Venezuela happened, but *how* it happened. Putting boots on the ground in a foreign country allied with major adversaries, without congressional approval—that was an incredibly risky political move. If even one US service member had been killed, the political consequences could have been catastrophic.

*"People who say Trump always chickens out don't understand how many risks he has taken."*

## Stablecoins: The Stealth Weapon

The final major topic: **US dollar stablecoins**.

Both Every and Johnson initially disliked crypto—Every called it "crap-toe" and saw NFTs as *"the madness of neoliberal economics taken to its furthest extreme."*

But the **GENIUS Act** changed everything.

**Why stablecoins matter:**

1. **Maintain dollar hegemony without the Triffin paradox**: A token for a dollar that is treated as a dollar but isn't a dollar, existing on a separate balance sheet outside the banking system

2. **Three dimensions instead of two**: The balance sheets change, the flows change, and American power gets entrenched in a whole new dimension

3. **Steal sovereignty**: If another country adopts US dollar stablecoins instead of local currency, it undermines the local authorities' ability to control both their populace and their economy

4. **Expand the dollar prison to the unbanked**: The Eurodollar system was already a prison, but this one operates outside the banking system. You can drain capital completely out of countries' banks into a new network

5. **Rebuild American factories simultaneously**: Unlike the Eurodollar system where American factories were dismantled as the prison went up, this system allows bricks to rebuild American factories at the same time

*"It's absolutely staggering what they could achieve. When we get control of the Fed and when we get stablecoins, that's when the real rubber hits the road."*

## Closing Thoughts

Every's final message:

*"We live in really interesting times. Don't go mad with it all. Try and just drill down to the basics, the real fundamentals—which is power."*

*"Understand that there are enormous opportunities in this as well as enormous risks. If you understand half of what we've tried to plot out for you here, you are infinitely better placed than a very high percentage of Wall Street, who just can't conceive of the fact that things could change from how they've been done for the past four and a half decades."*

*"You're ahead of the curve in having these conversations. You're probably better placed than larger institutions which are really going to find it hard to pivot rapidly enough to take advantage of them."*

*"Be encouraged rather than dismayed. Be of good cheer. But be very, very alert."*

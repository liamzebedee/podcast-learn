## Riva Tez & David Perell Conversation

# Part 1: Sequential Analysis

## First Third Analysis

### Overview

This conversation between David Perell and Riva Tez covers a rich tapestry of ideas around creativity, cultural decline, deep reading, faith, and the nature of inspiration. Riva Tez is a writer and essayist whose work critiques modern mediocrity, while David Perell is a writer and educator.

### Key Ideas and Arguments

**The Creativity Recession**

Both speakers identify a cultural crisis they term a "creativity recession." Riva argues this stems from:

- **The education system has narrowed dramatically**: Children are essentially being drugged into compliance.

  > "The education system has, the Overton window for education has become smaller and smaller to the point where like we're basically taking children and tying them to sort of like adult bulls on SSRIs... I say docile and delirious drones, drugged into oblivion, dishing out ADHD pills like Halloween candy."

- **Cultural nihilism**: Constant fear-mongering about climate change, war, and societal collapse creates a protective, defensive mindset antithetical to creative risk-taking.

- **Shortened time horizons**: If the world might end in 10 years, why build something beautiful that takes 40 years?

**The Death of Long-Term Thinking**

> "Imagine saying to someone in this present age, the guy spent 40 years just making a door, everyone would be like, what a joker... He spent 40 years making a door, and now everyone queues up to go see it because it's so beautiful. Did he not win? I think he won."

**The Vanishing Ability to Appreciate Subtlety**

David introduces the "vanilla" metaphor - vanilla is seen as boring, but it's actually a subtle, complex flavor. Modern sensory overload has destroyed our capacity for nuance.

**Faith as Foundation for Beautiful Work**

> "At some level trying to achieve anything great, you can't reason your way into some justification for wanting to do that... for me, so much of what faith has given me in terms of pursuing something beautiful is just like my relationship with God and just trying to please him."

**The Case Against Passive Media Consumption**

> "I'll start watching Netflix when I've read the whole of human history. Like, I'm really, I'd rather read the Odyssey a hundred times than watch Netflix. Like, I am not looking for passive entertainment."

### Notable Quotes

> "The West is dying and we are killing her. The American dream has been replaced by mass packaged mediocrity porn, encouraging us to revel like happy pigs in our own meekness."

> "Rilke saw beauty in everything. Like he describes, he's like, I'm looking at a door, a chair, a flower. I see the ecstasy of everything... He's not appealing to vast heavens. He's just noticing things around you and re-looking them from first principles and saying like, how beautiful life is."

> "When you memorize chapters, it takes a few months, but you really understand how things are structured and you understand the subtleties that almost get revealed to you through repetition."

### Surprising Insights

1. **The Manuscript Conspiracy**: Riva has written 80 pages investigating whether the Codex Sinaiticus - claimed to be the oldest complete New Testament manuscript from the 4th century - was actually doctored in the 19th century.

2. **Performative Minimalism**: Riva saw an Underworld concert where two older men with no stage production held an audience captive through sheer presence - contrasting this with Katy Perry's 75-actor theatrical spectacles.

3. **The Ayn Rand Method**: Riva argues that Ayn Rand's genius was embodying philosophical ideas in fictional characters rather than presenting them as logical arguments.

## Middle Third Analysis

### Key Ideas and Arguments

**The Value of Stillness and Unstructured Thinking**

> "I spend hours every day just thinking, like I'll lie in bed, I think about things. And I try to create space, like a vacuum in my mind, like not in a meditative sense, but like a space where like the, all the busyness of all my thoughts can come together and solidify."

> "You can't necessarily think yourself into the answers. You have to create space for the answers to come to you."

**The "Church of Graphs" - Critique of Over-Empiricism**

> "I wrote this long essay... documenting my following of the walking tour of Nietzsche... a few weeks after writing this essay, there was some, like, academic study that came out about how, like, walking was good for you. And I'm like, man, like, how much money and time was spent, like, making this essay... just go read Nietzsche."

**The Occam's Razor Misunderstanding**

William of Ockham was a theologian using logic to justify divine miracles, not a rationalist. His "simplest explanation" argument was that the simplest answer is God.

**Cultural Desensitization and Drug Trends**

- **90s/2000s**: Uppers (cocaine, MDMA, ecstasy) - boom times, rave culture
- **Now**: Downers (alcohol, weed, ketamine, SSRIs) - anesthetic, depressive

> "You're in this position where everybody is desensitized. It's like, does the overwhelming things come first and the desensitization come after? Or are people desensitized and then they need the more loud things?"

**Authenticity in Writing and Creative Work**

> "The reason why I can write like that is that I'm writing about something that I genuinely care about... I was mad, right? And like in that madness, I thought, how can I express it?"

### Notable Quotes

> "How much time a day do you spend thinking? They're like, thinking, what do you mean? I was like, I'm just like sitting and thinking... No, I'm always doing something."

> "You've got to experience the lows to experience the highs, right? Like, I'd rather oscillate than plateau."

> "I was really upset when my father died. I didn't, I thought it was like, meds, like not grieve so much. I was like, no, I should feel this. I was like, this is an important lesson for me to understand and for me to feel."

> "If my dream situation, my transhumanist future, my transhumanist dream is I never need to sleep. I could just be in front of a computer in my books all day and just read."

### Surprising Insights

1. **Drug trends as cultural barometer**: The shift from uppers (90s/2000s) to downers (today) reflects a society numbing itself against overwhelming stimuli.

2. **Avicenna discovered germ theory in the 11th century**: But it was ignored because it came from the medieval period.

3. **Petit Plato's**: Riva ran a philosophy school for children in the back of her toy shop.

4. **Walking 8 miles daily**: Riva walks sometimes eight miles in a morning for thinking time.

## Final Third Analysis

### Key Ideas and Arguments

**On Reading and Intellectual Freedom**

> "Don't force yourself to read books if you don't like it. Everyone's like, well, I don't really like this book, but I can read it. I'm like, well, stop reading it."

> "Go find things that resonate with you, right? And like, don't be embarrassed by it... I don't know many people who's like reading Rilke."

**The Humility Argument for Consciousness**

> "95 percent of all observable reality is just labeled as dark matter that we don't understand... maybe we shouldn't be very humble that we don't understand how things work."

> "I'm not making the case that I know what consciousness is. I'm just saying that I'm not fully bought in to the current paradigm and questioning it is like total heresy."

**The AI Hubris Critique**

> "These are very loaded terms. These are very loaded terms that you haven't introspected on a lot. We don't even know what those definitions mean. Like we don't have a collective definitions of even what the word intelligence means."

> "People who've never thought about thinking, never thought about thinking, we're engineers, we've thought about how to build things from the ground up using code. There's been a lot of philosophical thought on what it means to justify a belief. That's the field of epistemology."

**The Death of Formality and Effort**

> "It's cringe to try, right? Like it's cringe to try. Now everything's reduced..."

**The Two Cultures Problem**

Historical geniuses - Einstein, McLuhan, Steve Jobs, J.P. Morgan - all had deep engagement with philosophy, spirituality, or the arts.

> "Einstein died with a book from like an Indian mystic right next to him on his bed. Marshall McLuhan, who was like a crazy media theorist... he was like obsessed with Catholicism."

**Handwriting as Somatic Experience**

> "When you're typing, the mistakes, delete, delete, delete, and so you lose the mistakes... creativity is sometimes recognizing the best mistakes that you've made and actually building on them."

**Beauty as Natural Superiority**

> "Beauty, Plato's quote, beauty is a natural superiority. It plays to meritocracy. Like there is some objective standards of beauty."

> "There are natural hierarchies. Denying them is denying science."

### Notable Quotes

> "All the bestseller books are like how to be more productive. It's all nonfiction about how to like, you're messed up and here's like nonfiction about how you can be less messed up, which is a weird cultural, again, perverse thing going around that like we all need like to be fixed."

> "If you're sensitive, you start to notice that there's a little, there's like magic. There's like some, you can tap into it. It's not magic in the way that people think of it, but it's like serendipity and like synchronicity."

> "We don't literally put young people in trash bags and charge 900. And it's like, you're just showing how much you don't care. Right. And you're paying a lot to not care. So it's like, I'm rich and I don't care, which is like the main message of fashion right now."

# Part 2: Thematic Analysis

## Riva Tez's Personal Philosophy

### How to Live a Good Life

**Cultivate Deep Sensitivity and Resist Desensitization**

> "I'm just not desensitizing myself. Like the real core is like, I'm not drinking too much. I'm not on a bunch of drugs and I'm not on SSRIs. And I feel like when you get to a very neutral state... living is hard."

**Embrace Oscillation Over Plateau**

> "You've got to experience the lows to experience the highs, right? Like, I'd rather oscillate than plateau. Like, I'd rather feel how in the hardness of life you can also then appreciate later the beauty."

**Radical Selectivity in Consumption**

> "I am so perplexed by how open people are to just consuming the media that is around them passively. I'm like, I'm very selective what I put inside my mind."

### The Role of Discipline and Routine

**Against Forced Regimentation - For Natural Creative Cycles**

> "I go through phases... when I go through like research phases, I pick up something that I'm studying and I can't do anything else. I like, I know everyone says that you should do everything in moderation. I write a little bit every day, but I just get fanatical and I have to study whatever I'm looking at and I can't think about other things. Like I become obsessive."

**Allowing Creative Cycles**

> "I used to when I was younger, try and force it. I'd be like, why can't it come now? Like, why can't I do it here and then? And I've just learned as I've got older to say like, Hey, come cyclically. And sometimes you can concentrate on it and sometimes you can't, but don't put pressure on yourself."

### Relationships and Love

**Skepticism of Settling**

> "I went back to my high school reunion and everyone was like still dating each other. And I was like, wait, what? I go, I was like, there's a whole world out there. How is it the chance that you all found the best people in this one moment of your life?"

**Wanting Multiple Lives and Loves**

> "I dream of many different careers, many different lives, many different loves, many different renewals of myself. As if I was an immortal being who was able to experiment and explore across an endless timeline."

### Success and Achievement

**Legacy Over ROI - The 40-Year Door**

> "He spent 40 years making a door, and now everyone queues up to go see it because it's so beautiful. Did he not win? I think he won."

**The Transhumanist Dream**

> "If my dream situation, my transhumanist future, my transhumanist dream is I never need to sleep. I could just be by computer in my books all day and just read. Like it is so fun to just go, the whole human knowledge is out there for you to discover."

### Death and Mortality

**Living as if Immortal**

> "Is it cooler to live as if you'll live forever? Because if you live as if you're gonna like you plan your life, like I'm gonna live on average 85 years or whatever... If you were immortal... you wouldn't have one job, right? You would probably do different things and experience stuff."

**Death as Teacher - Not to Be Numbed**

> "I was really upset when my father died. I didn't, I thought it was like, meds, like not grieve so much. I was like, no, I should feel this."

---

### How They View Modern Culture and Technology

**Education System as Factory for Conformity:**
> "Docile and delirious drones, drugged into oblivion, dishing out ADHD pills like Halloween candy."

**Modern Architecture as Spiritual Death:**
> "Every single one of the screenshots had bare white walls... Where is the spirit? Where is the distinctiveness? Where is the personality?"

**Fashion as Anti-Aesthetic:**
> "We literally put young people in trash bags and charge $900... I'm rich and I don't care, which is like the main message of fashion right now."

### Solutions and Alternatives Proposed

1. Deep reading and studying classical texts
2. Solitude and stillness
3. Disengaging from modern media
4. Authentic emotional expression
5. Return to beauty and craftsmanship
6. Divine/spiritual connection

## Creativity, Art, and Writing

### What They Say About Creative Work

**The Necessity of Feeling and Authenticity**

> "I wasn't, didn't sit down and plan that essay. It was during lockdowns, it was COVID, I was looking out my window at, like, you know, a world that had gone shut down and people were protesting. And it just, I wrote that essay in one go. It's emotional."

> "If you can get to that point where you care so much, the writing comes very naturally."

**Creating Space for Ideas**

> "You can't necessarily think yourself into the answers. You have to create space for the answers to come to you."

**The Manic Energy of Deep Work**

> "It's such an energy rush, it's like taking amphetamines, like I just, I'm not on anything, but I just get so excited, I can't sleep, it's like, it's like I get manic creative energy."

### Artists and Writers They Admire

**Rainer Maria Rilke** - For finding transcendence in ordinary things
**Ayn Rand** - For embodying philosophy in characters
**Friedrich Nietzsche** - For his aphoristic style and authentic expression
**Charles Bukowski and Henry Miller** - For raw, authentic emotional writing

### Writing as Word Painting

> "Writing being like word paintings, right? Like, you're a painter, we both are pointillism... many different colored dots, when you go up close, look like nonsense, when you come away, it's like a beautiful scene."

---

## Religion, Spirituality, and Transcendence

### What Role Does Religion Play?

Both speakers view religion as foundational to Western civilization and creativity:

> "There's this book that for some reason, even if you don't think about it, it has shaped human history, especially in the West... It's the most read book in the world. Like the Bible is like, maybe people should consider it."

### Spiritual Practices Discussed

**David Perell on daily Bible study:**
> "Every single morning I'm reading a chapter of the Bible. And I don't read passively. I have a notebook and I'm reading a chapter really, really carefully... it's changed my life more than any other learning habit."

**Riva on the Islamic call to prayer:**
> "To hear the call to prayer five times a day... It really stop me to pause and reflect. It dices up my days."

### Transcendence and Ecstasy

> "The guy writes about ecstasy... Rilke saw beauty in everything. Like he describes, he's like, I'm looking at a door, a chair, a flower. I see the ecstasy of everything."

### Divine Inspiration

> "I now put so much stake in the idea of revelation... I sometimes feel like God just airdrops me clear ideas."

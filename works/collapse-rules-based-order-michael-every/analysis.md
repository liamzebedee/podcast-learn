# Analysis: The Collapse of the Rules-Based Order

**Source:** Conversation between Brent Johnson and Michael Every (Global Strategist, Rabo Bank)

---

## Executive Summary

This conversation presents a comprehensive framework for understanding the current geopolitical transformation through the lens of "economic statecraft." The central thesis: **the collapse of the liberal world order does not signal American decline—it signals America's strategic pivot from cooperative hegemon to assertive practitioner of unified economic-military power.**

---

## 1. Core Arguments and Thesis

### Main Thesis

America built the liberal world order and is now deliberately dismantling it. This is not retreat but strategic refocusing—"prioritization, not abandonment."

### The Economic Statecraft Framework

- **Economic Policy**: Disconnected decisions about trade, finance, military (the old way)
- **Economic Statecraft**: Combining all levers "like fingers and a thumb into a fist" with unified purpose

The guiding question: **"What is GDP for?"** This shifts from market-driven to purpose-driven economics.

### Logical Structure

1. The liberal world order is collapsing
2. Common misunderstanding: Collapse = American decline
3. Reality: America built this order and is choosing to dismantle it
4. The framework shift: Economic statecraft (unified strategic use of all power)
5. Historical parallel: "Reverse Perestroika"
6. Mechanisms: Office of Strategic Capital, defense spending, stablecoins, Fed control
7. Geographic strategy: Monroe Doctrine + contested Eurasian borders

## 2. Geopolitical Themes

### US Foreign Policy Shift

From maintaining a "liberal world order" to aggressive "economic statecraft." The Machiavellian logic applies: better to be feared than loved if you must choose.

### Spheres of Influence (The Risk Board Analogy)

- **Americas**: Full control (Monroe Doctrine reasserted)
- **Europe**: Force self-sufficiency, prevent Eurasian consolidation
- **Asia**: Contain China, deny resources
- **Middle East**: Neutralize Iran

### Country-Specific Analysis

| Country/Region | Role | Strategic Purpose |
|----------------|------|-------------------|
| Venezuela | Resource denial | Keep oil from China ("physical censorship") |
| Iran | Regime change target | Disrupt Chinese energy supply |
| Greenland | Strategic geography | Space-based solar, energy independence |
| Europe | Forced self-defense | "Wet paper bag" military must step up |
| China | Primary competitor | 250:1 shipbuilding advantage; must be contained |
| Latin America | Parallel industrialization | "Inclusive imperialism" under Monroe Doctrine |

---

## 3. Economic Frameworks

### The "What is GDP for?" Framework

Challenges the neoliberal assumption that growth is an end in itself. Different answers lead to radically different policy architectures.

### Reverse Perestroika

| Gorbachev (1985-1991) | Trump (Present) |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Command → Market economy | Consumer → Command/military economy |
| Military → Consumer goods | Consumer → Military/industrial goods |
| Glasnost (transparency) | Free speech push |
| Failed catastrophically | Attempting the reverse |

### Neoliberalism Critique

The current shift demolishes the 45-year neoliberal consensus:
- Free trade without strategic considerations
- Offshoring manufacturing
- Financialization and consumption-driven growth
- Treating economics as politically neutral

### Commodity Bifurcation

A coming split in global commodity streams where each bloc wants low prices for themselves and high prices for competitors. Markets haven't priced this in yet.

---

## 4. Historical Parallels

### Gorbachev/Soviet Collapse
- The central cautionary tale
- Partial reforms led to total collapse
- Trump attempting the reverse direction—equally risky

### Pre-WWI Great Power Competition
- Return to explicit spheres of influence
- "The Great Game" dynamics
- Risk-style territorial logic

### Monroe Doctrine (1823)
- Now explicitly reasserted
- Venezuela as proving ground
- Latin America as American sphere

### Classical Economics (Smith/Ricardo)
- Original vision: industrialize domestically, trade at the margin
- Neoliberalism perverted this into offshoring everything
- Current policy is a return to classical principles

### Letters of Marque
- Constitutional provision for privateering
- Predicted to return; now entering Overton window
- Recently floated for drug interdiction

## 5. Key Actors and Institutions

### Primary Figures

| Actor | Role | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Michael Every | Global Strategist, Rabo Bank | Developed economic statecraft framework |
| Donald Trump | US President | Executing "reverse perestroika" |
| Steve Feinberg | Head of Office of Strategic Capital | Coordinates public-private reindustrialization |

### Critical Institutions

| Institution | Significance |
|-------------|--------------|
| The Federal Reserve | "The battleground"—control essential for transformation |
| Office of Strategic Capital | $200B+ leverage capacity; quarterback for industrial policy |
| Department of Defense | Budget potentially increasing to $1.5T/year |

## 6. The Stablecoin Thesis

### Why Stablecoins Matter

They represent a **third dimension** of dollar dominance:
1. Domestic dollar system
2. Eurodollar system (offshore banking)
3. Stablecoin system (outside banking entirely)

### Key Advantages

1. **Solve the Triffin Paradox**: Dollar hegemony without trade deficit requirement
2. **Steal sovereignty**: Undermines local currency control when adopted
3. **Expand to unbanked**: Creates dollar demand from new populations
4. **Rebuild simultaneously**: Unlike Eurodollars, allows reindustrialization

### The GENIUS Act

Transforms stablecoins from libertarian experiment to tool of state power.

---

## 7. Investment Implications

### Bullish Sectors

| Sector | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Defense | $1.5T budget = direct fiscal stimulus |
| Latin American commodities | Monroe Doctrine + parallel industrialization |
| Stablecoin infrastructure | Regulatory tailwinds via GENIUS Act |
| Domestic manufacturing | Office of Strategic Capital backing |

### Key Framework Shift

Stop analyzing policy in isolation. Monetary, fiscal, trade, foreign, and military policy are now combined into a unified fist. The question is no longer "what will markets do?" but "what does the state need to achieve?"

### Who Benefits

Those who understand the shift are "infinitely better placed than a very high percentage of Wall Street, who just can't conceive of the fact that things could change."

## 8. Risks and Uncertainties

### Execution Risks

| Risk | Severity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Reverse Perestroika failure | Catastrophic | Historical precedent (Gorbachev) ended in collapse |
| Political coalition fracture | High | "Groyper" phenomenon emerged faster than expected |
| Venezuela escalation | High | One casualty could be politically catastrophic |
| Fed battle failure | High | Control is essential; failure derails everything |

### Acknowledged Unknowns

- Whether reindustrialization can happen faster than 10-15 years
- Whether AI/3D printing will revolutionize manufacturing
- Whether the political coalition holds through 2026/2028
- Whether Europe actually steps up on defense
- Full implications of stablecoins still being understood

### Structural Vulnerability

The strategy depends on multiple factors aligning:
1. Successful economic transition (historically unprecedented)
2. Political coalition holding multiple cycles
3. Avoiding military casualties
4. Controlling the Fed
5. Europe stepping up
6. Innovation delivering faster capacity
7. Stablecoin strategy working as theorized

**Failure in any major area could cascade.**

## 9. Key Quotes

### On Economic Statecraft
> "The key difference between policy and statecraft is with statecraft you combine all of them together—like fingers and a thumb into a fist."

### On the Liberal Order
> "The confusion comes from mistaking prioritization for abandonment."

### On Power
> "Machiavelli said, 'Is it better to be loved or feared?' And it's better to be feared if you have to choose."

### On the Fed
> "If one can't see that the Fed is a battleground here after the headlines of the past few days, you're in the wrong job."

### On Stablecoins
> "When we get control of the Fed and when we get stablecoins, that's when the real rubber hits the road."

### On Wall Street
> "If you understand half of what we've tried to plot out for you here, you are infinitely better placed than a very high percentage of Wall Street."

### Closing Wisdom
> "Be encouraged rather than dismayed. Be of good cheer. But be very, very alert."

## 10. Conclusion

This conversation presents a unified framework for understanding the current moment as a deliberate American strategic pivot, not decline. The key insight is that **economics and geopolitics can no longer be separated**—the world has entered an era of economic statecraft where all policy tools serve strategic objectives.

The opportunity exists for those who recognize the shift before institutional players can adapt. The risk is that, like Gorbachev's reforms, this ambitious restructuring could fail catastrophically.

The fundamental analytical lens: **power**. Everything else follows from understanding who holds it and how they intend to use it.

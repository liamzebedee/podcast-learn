# Why No One Should Watch Netflix: A Conversation on Beauty, Reading, and the Decline of the Creative Spirit

*A conversation between David Perell and Riva Tez exploring philosophy, deep reading, authenticity in writing, and what we've lost in the modern age.*

---

## On Rilke and the Ecstasy of Seeing

**David Perell:** Riva, why does Rilke's poetry resonate with you so deeply?

**Riva Tez:** The guy writes about **ecstasy**, and that word has kind of become corrupted now. In the past you'd think about religious ecstasy or spiritual ecstasy. But Rilke saw beauty in everything. He describes looking at a door, a chair, a flower, and seeing the ecstasy of everything. He sees in one little thing a representation of all things that are beautiful.

I don't know many writers that can notice with such subtlety, detail that provokes such beauty. He's not appealing to vast heavens. He's just noticing things around you and re-looking at them from first principles and saying, *"How beautiful life is."* It's just very moving. I think it deeply resonates with some people, not with everybody, but if you're an ecstatic person, then yes.

**David:** It's funny that you talk about the beauty and subtlety. I've been thinking a lot about the word **vanilla**. People see vanilla as a bad thing, but actually vanilla is a very subtle flavor. I think it speaks to the sensory overload of the modern age, where something that does have that subtlety, it's like people don't even have the receptors to appreciate it. How contoured something can be in these very subtle ways.

## The Art of Performance Without Spectacle

**Riva:** I went to an Underworld concert last night. These two older guys with no stage, no elaborate set. But they have such vibe that they hold all your attention just with gentle body movements. He was such an incredible dancer, not in a cheesy way, but he held everyone's attention because it was as if the music flowed through him.

You compare that to something like Katy Perry. She has like 75 actors waving around, sets like Universal Studios, because I think to actually strip that back and have people perform songs, we've lost the ability. People have such a short attention span that they need something so theatrical.

Last night there was such elegance in this guy's performance. No set, but everybody was hypnotic, everyone was so captivated by it. But now everything has to be shocking because we don't have good attention spans anymore.

---

## The Lost Art of Deep Reading

**David:** I think this comes back to writing in the way that we don't read things as much repetitively. When most people think about reading, they think about how many books they read this year, or reading the news. But the Greeks memorized poems.

I was in a Bible study and there's a guy named Jimmy. His understanding of scripture is just next level from everybody else. I said, Jimmy, how do you know the Bible so well? He goes, *"You know what I do that no one else does? I memorize entire chapters of the Bible."* When you memorize chapters, it takes a few months, but you really understand how things are structured and you understand the subtleties that get revealed to you through repetition.

**Riva:** Not even just that. You learn more as you get older, which allows you to unlock things in texts that you might have missed before. I've probably read *Atlas Shrugged* every two years for like 15 years. I look back and wish I'd understood it better as a teenager, but you had to have the wisdom and the experiences to unlock the context of the things she was referring to.

If there's books that moved you when you were younger, it's worth going back and rereading them to see what nuggets you couldn't possibly have had comprehension for when you were a little bit more naive. I read books regularly that I've read before because I have placed in them some value, some lessons I want to learn from, and perhaps more than I just haven't discovered yet.

## Why Ayn Rand's Writing Works

**David:** Why is her writing so captivating to you?

**Riva:** She takes philosophy and instead of making it *"here's an argument as to why you shouldn't subscribe to X,"* she puts the characteristics that she values in characters. By doing that, you see the embodiment of those characters and their actions in a way that invokes a much deeper and richer experience of what those qualities might look like in real life.

So she took complicated philosophy and embodied it in a way that anybody could resonate with. You see your friends in the characters. Sometimes when people piss me off, I'm like, *"They remind me of Lillian Rearden."* She gave you that framework to understand what she was pointing to in a much deeper way.

## Philosophy as the No Man's Land

**David:** I'm always amazed at the percentage of people I admire, how they think, how they reason, how they move through the world, how many of them studied philosophy. What's going on with the disconnect of "oh philosophy is a useless major" and "oh my goodness there's something so core here"?

**Riva:** I remember when I applied for my philosophy undergrad, I opened my letter to University College London using Bertrand Russell's definition of philosophy: that **philosophy is a no man's land between theology and science**. I really liked that as an answer. It's asking questions that lots of other groups are trying to answer, but it's the question formation.

The thing that frustrated me about my philosophy degree is that I found just studying the history of the questions less interesting than trying to figure them out. Contemporary academic philosophy becomes about reciting Descartes' questions. What I wanted to do was, okay, well, how do we go about solving this? And they'd say, no, no, we leave that to the other realms.

Now actually Oxford University recommends doing philosophy alongside a science. Philosophy and physics would have been my dream course. Ask the questions, go think about them.

---

## The Creativity Recession

**David:** When you want to take a risk, you get really excited. What's going on there? We've said we're in a **creativity recession**.

**Riva:** I think the education system has narrowed the Overton window to the point where we're basically taking children and tying them to adult bulls on SSRIs. *"Docile and delirious drones, drugged into oblivion, dishing out ADHD pills like Halloween candy."*

People care a lot about freedom and agency in adults without realizing that people lose it as children. The other thing is cultural nihilism. There's lots of negative messaging going on in society. We're always close to the world ending from climate change, always at the threat of war. In that period of keeping people scared, it's hard to take risks or be creative because you're trying to be protective and defensive.

**David:** There's something to a short time horizon and a lack of beauty. What is the point of making something beautiful if the world's going to end in 10 years? Like, why would you even take on that challenge?

**Riva:** 100%. People who built beautiful churches 500 years ago had shorter life expectancies than we did. But how people thought of themselves inside structures of the church, what eternal means, there was different reasoning. There was lifetime, which you were alive, and then there was your **legacy**. Your legacy was if not more valuable than your life, because your life was so fragile.

Now people are really healthy. They're full of fear, even though they live three times as long as anyone in the 16th century. In that culture of fear, we move towards hedonism and short-term rewards. It's crazy now to think of spending 50 years building something. But in the past, it was building together towards higher purposes and legacy and something divine.

---

## On Faith and Building for Beauty

**David:** At some level, trying to achieve anything great, you can't reason your way into some justification for wanting to do that. It's almost hard to quantify the outer limits of beauty. You just know something is beautiful. You can't look at the Duomo in Florence and explain the ROI economic value. For me, so much of what faith has given me in terms of pursuing something beautiful is just my relationship with God and trying to please him.

**Riva:** My mother is currently studying Vasari's Lives of the Artists, an account of 16th century Italian artists. One of them is Masaccio, who spent 40 years just making the door of the Duomo of Florence.

Imagine saying to someone in this present age that a guy spent 40 years just making a door. Everyone would be like, "What a joker." But there's something so beautiful in that. He said, *"I want to get this little thing. I have this little opportunity to deliver beauty on something that's going to last for hundreds, if not thousands of years. And I'm going to put my everything into it."*

There's a level of formality of showing up to the craft that we're really missing now because we're surrounded by cheap and short-term things, from furniture to media. Everything is cheap and fast. He spent 40 years making a door, and now everyone queues up to go see it because it's so beautiful. Did he not win? I think he won.

## Why No One Should Watch Netflix

**Riva:** In the last two years I've just completely disengaged from mainstream media. I looked at the top 50 grossing films of the last decade. I'd seen maybe one of them. From Mad Men to any cultural references you've heard, I've never consumed a second. I've never watched Netflix.

It puts me in a state of some fear because I don't always know exactly what's going on in the world, but it will get to me eventually. I am so perplexed by how open people are to just consuming the media that is around them passively.

*"I'll start watching Netflix when I've read the whole of human history."*

I'd rather read the Odyssey a hundred times than watch Netflix. I am not looking for passive entertainment. I'm so surprised by how many of my smart intellectual friends come home and they just zone out to TV shows. I can't think of anything worse. I have so many things I want to learn. I don't want to just be entertained.

---

## Against 3x Speed

**David:** Something I've really come to appreciate is just the value of **deep reading**. I wrote a piece a few years ago called "Against 3x Speed," basically a condemnation of this idea of consuming faster.

I got in the car with somebody and he was listening to an audiobook at 5x speed. He said, "Yeah, what I do is I've figured out it's better to listen to it two or three times but at that speed." It gave me so much anxiety.

Then I had friends at Columbia, and they invited me to a class. The entire semester was on 300 pages of Max Weber, basically all about the Protestant work ethic. I was like, this is interesting. I never realized you could go so deep in something.

Now I've ended up all the way on the other side of the barbell. The only book I read is the Bible. Every day I try to understand one little section of the Old Testament and the New Testament. I read it, then I read one study Bible, then another, get the etymologies. Then based on that, I journal on what do I need to know, who do I need to be, what do I need to do.

I've been doing it for six months and it's changed my life more than any other learning habit. Not even close. It's changed me at the level of my heart, not just my mind.

---

## The Intellectual Embarrassment of Not Reading Scripture

**Riva:** If you ask some intellectual if they've read Plato, they'll be really embarrassed if they haven't. Haven't read Nietzsche? Really embarrassed. Haven't read Kant? Very embarrassed. Haven't read the Bible? And they'll be proud to have not read the Bible. *"I have resisted such dogma. I am in the age of reason now."*

The fact that you can disregard a text that has been so foundational to all of Western thought, even just from an anthropological standpoint, why is our culture the way it is? It's the most read book in the world. Maybe people should consider it. The fact that that's a radical position is crazy.

---

## Down the Rabbit Hole of New Testament Manuscripts

**David:** I hear you've been studying the manuscripts of the New Testament?

**Riva:** When I was thinking about what I should work on next, I started thinking about history as a field. History sounds soft and friendly, but history is kind of the foundation of propaganda. How people define the past is how people place themselves in the present.

I thought to myself, let me think of a book that has been foundational. I thought, if I'm going to study the New Testament, I want to read the oldest New Testament. The oldest claiming complete New Testament copy is the **Codex Sinaiticus**, discovered in the late 19th century by Constantine Tischendorf, supposedly from the fourth century. It's meant to be one of Constantine's 50 Bibles.

I started looking into this story, and it just got weirder and weirder. I've probably written 80 pages on it so far. Tischendorf claims he found the manuscript in Mount Sinai Monastery in Egypt, the oldest continuous Christian monastery in the world. He says he rescued the oldest Bible from monks who were using it to start fires.

Now that story is a little weird because it's a beautiful text, made on parchment, not papyrus, very expensive. No monastery would use this as fire paper. Even if it was heretical, Christians and Jews don't burn texts, they bury them. Think about the Dead Sea Scrolls. If it's heretical, you bury it near a cemetery.

My argument is that this original New Testament manuscript is not actually from the 4th century; it's probably been doctored in the 19th. That's not to refute Christianity. I think the guy was trying to get glory and say he found the oldest.

**David:** You're willing to ask questions that other people aren't willing to ask. If the world of ideas has guardrails like bumpers at a bowling alley, you just kick them over and keep going.

---

## On Following Curiosity Without a Plan

**Riva:** I went in just thinking I'm going to read the New Testament. Then I thought, what's the oldest New Testament? Then, how did they discover this? I don't go in with a set plan. I just followed my own curiosity.

People don't really value this kind of free-flow research anymore. You're gonna do a PhD program that has to solve some niche question within a scientific paradigm. It's just so fun to go in and not have a goal.

I found one professor, Daniel Wallace, a theologian who runs the Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts. I'm really bonded with him. I feel like an investigative journalist. I don't know what I'm looking for. I just keep going until I find stuff, and then I just keep poking. It's like, "Hurrah! I found something."

---

## Creating Space for Revelation

**David:** How do you structure your life to be able to do this?

**Riva:** Not well. I go through phases. When I go through research phases, I can't do anything else. I know everyone says you should do everything in moderation, write a little bit every day, but I get fanatical. I have to study whatever I'm looking at and can't think about other things. I become obsessive.

When I researched my pathogen essay, that was six months of me just only thinking about pathogens. It's my happiest place. I sit at my desk, I write, I have all my notes on the wall, I look like a crazy person, and I just go full in. It's such an energy rush, like taking amphetamines. I'm not on anything, but I just get so excited I can't sleep. It's like manic creative energy.

I used to try and force it when I was younger. I've learned to say, hey, it comes cyclically. Sometimes you can concentrate on it and sometimes you can't. Don't put pressure on yourself. Let it just happen when it happens. Inside that freedom, I think it's easier to get into flow state.

**David:** This idea of the **muses** shows up in Greek poetry, in the art in Florence. What do you think it's pointing at?

**Riva:** It's like the etymology of the word "genius," right? There's a genie who comes and turns you into a genius. It's some sort of divine inspiration, some esoteric, metaphysical inspiration where you deliver the message and it gets given to you.

Some of my favorite writers have said, *"I didn't write this. It was just channeled through me in one go."* When I go back and read my old essays, I'm like, how did I know these things? I don't even recognize who I was when I wrote it. You change mindset, go into a different state of mind.

I can tell it's in Rilke. When I read Rilke's poetry, I see he gets into that ecstatic curiosity phase. He's using words that point to a feeling, the ecstasy of aloneness and discovery.

---

## The Power of Being Alone

**Riva:** It perplexes me how much people don't spend time alone. They're always doing something. I had this conversation with friends the other day. I said, how much time a day do you spend thinking? They're like, thinking? What do you mean? I said, just sitting and thinking. They said, no, I'm always doing something.

I spend hours every day just thinking. I'll lie in bed, think about things. I try to create space, a vacuum in my mind, not in a meditative sense, but a space where all the busyness of my thoughts can come together and solidify.

I walk sometimes eight miles in the morning. In that process of being alone and in nature, I get into a different state. The synapses fire and I see new thoughts. When I look at a flower, I see some synergy of colors that synergizes some other thought in my mind. I'm a hundred percent open to that being different parts of divine revelation.

*"You can't necessarily think yourself into the answers. You have to create space for the answers to come to you."*

How many people are alone? Even when they're alone, they're on their phones. How many people can actually sit with themselves and be alone for a long period of time? I think when you can get to that state, the thoughts come much more easily.

---

## Sensitivity and the Overwhelm of Modern Life

**Riva:** One of the reasons why I can't watch mainstream media or even really go to a restaurant anymore is that when you get sensitive to things, contemporary society is very overwhelming. My place in LA is a very old school greenhouse. There's no technology. I just have a bunch of books, loads of candles. Sometimes I'll go to a restaurant in LA and I'm so lost from this. Everything's screaming at you, everything is loud.

It makes you become introverted. People don't think of me as an introvert, but I get really overly stimulated from going to different things. But there's such beauty in having the ability to take notice of such fine details.

**David:** What I do whenever I go to the shopping mall is walk into Neiman Marcus to the high-end areas. My favorite brand is **Brunello Cucinelli**. I'm dissecting the cashmere, reading through the book, feeling the texture of the paper. I probably spend 30 minutes just noticing the subtlety, reading the tags and feeling them.

Then I instantly went to the Balenciaga section and it was an assault on my senses. I had mild grade trauma from just that sharp transition.

**Riva:** Why is everything so loud now? Look at the drugs that people are doing. In the 90s and 2000s, think about rave culture, Wall Street. It was uppers. People were taking coke, MDMA, ecstasy. They were raving and partying, Wall Street was booming, the dot-com bubble.

Now look at the drugs people are doing. Alcohol is a depressant. Young people are smoking weed, which is also depressive. There's a lot of ketamine going on, which is an anesthetic. If people aren't doing those, they're on SSRIs or antipsychotics. So everybody is desensitized.

Does the overwhelming stimulus come first and the desensitization come after? Or are people desensitized and then they need the louder things? That's a really interesting question. An anesthetic? You're literally trying to turn yourself off from life. Culture is kind of weird now.

## The West is Dying and We Are Killing Her

**David:** You have this amazing introduction in your writing. You say: *"The West is dying and we are killing her. We're proud to destroy our own freedoms and repackage failure as democratic progress. We champion our rolling out of red tape, the bureaucratic creep that strangles the nation's liberty. The American Dream has been replaced by mass-packaged mediocrity porn, encouraging us to revel like happy pigs in our own meekness."* Yo, that rips.

**Riva:** I wrote that essay during lockdowns, COVID. I was looking out my window at a world that had gone shut down and people were protesting. I wrote it in one go. It's emotional. The reason I can write like that is I'm writing about something I genuinely care about. I was mad.

How can I express it? I'm not going to protest. I'm going to write it. If you can get to that point where you care so much, the writing comes very naturally. It's not like I had to think about the words or look at thesaurus.com. I felt it so intensely that it became like poetry because it came from my heart.

When I read it afterwards, I thought maybe I should tone it down a bit. Then I was like, nah. I should put out exactly how my heart wanted this to be.

**David:** The core thing is just letting yourself feel that rather than rejecting it. We have something in society right now. Anger is bad. Vengeance is bad. Rage is bad. Taking those emotions and just throwing them on the page, letting them loose. It's like spewing a cannon out of your soul. I'm all for that. But I don't think most people allow themselves to feel that emotion.

**Riva:** I'm just not desensitizing myself. I'm not drinking too much. I'm not on a bunch of drugs. I'm not on SSRIs. When you get to a very neutral state, living is hard. A good phrase I tell myself is that *"you've got to experience the lows to experience the highs."* I'd rather oscillate than plateau. I'd rather feel the hardness of life so you can also appreciate later the beauty.

I was really upset when my father died. I thought about meds to not grieve so much. But I was like, no, I should feel this. This is an important lesson for me to understand.

By not being desensitized, these emotions come. People love authenticity. People think they have to fit into the Overton window, be professional. But what people are really missing in society is authenticity. You can't read that essay and be like, she doesn't mean it. I'm clearly authentic.

Read Bukowski. Read *The Tropic of Cancer*. Even F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald, she was in and out of asylums, writing things as revenge to her husband. There was so much drama, such ups and downs. You read Bukowski and you know he feels it.

I can't read contemporary poems. It's like, *"You must be kind, blah, blah, blah, says tree to house."* I'm just like, what is going on? You can't feel the emotion. It doesn't feel authentic to me anymore.

## Making the Film "Every Angel is Terrifying"

**David:** What did you do differently writing for the film "Every Angel is Terrifying"?

**Riva:** I didn't start with the plan of it becoming a film. I got asked to speak at the Urbit conference in Miami. I hadn't made slides even the day before. Classic me. I don't need to overly prep for things I care about.

Mike Ma designed it. Mike is one of the great writers and also an extremely talented artist. Someone who writes from the heart, authentic. *Harassment Architecture* is a crazy book. He combines the philosophy and freedom of someone like Ayn Rand with Brett Easton Ellis in the 90s.

That speech, which I delivered having not practiced, went really well. It had a standing ovation. We thought maybe this message should be packaged. The video is just the speech cut down. We didn't rewrite it. We took the recording, cut out the crypto-specific stuff, and left the philosophy and history.

I found it uncomfortable. There's something more personal about putting things in your own voice. I like to hide behind writing. I see the distance between myself and the words. To do a voiceover, even a speech, is not how I feel comfortable.

I've had people say it really moved them and made them rethink their life choices. But I can't watch that video. As a writer, I struggled to hear it. But yes, I'm proud of it.

**David:** I loved it so much I had to go make my own short film, inspired by it, asking what would I add to the conversation. I felt like that video tapped into a dark energy I hadn't really seen expressed. Then when I made "You Were Made for More Than This," I wanted to start with that and then provide a more concrete, cheerier solution for if you're stuck in this world, trapped in your job and you want to make something more of yourself.

I wrote, *"Carve the path that only you can carve, live the life that only you can live, write the essay that only you can write."* A sentence like that could have only come out in a video script. I would have never written that.

---

## The Church of Graphs

**Riva:** Beyond just truth, it's also common sense. I call this the **Church of Graphs**. I wrote an essay documenting my following of Nietzsche's walking tour. A few weeks after, there was some academic study about how walking was good for you.

I'm like, how much money and time was spent making this study? "We've got an abstract. This is the correlatory thing between walking and being good for people." It's just comedy. I agree we should question things. But people just know walking is good for you. Go read Nietzsche. There's a lot of people in history who'll tell you walking is good for you.

Traditions and thoughts passed on generations that we doubt them all now. Anything medieval has been completely disregarded. Avicenna, who wrote about medicine in the 11th century, actually discovered germ theory, but no one cared because it was from the medieval period. We're disregarding entire things that don't fit into the current paradigm.

Ockham's razor is now used as this logical way to prove things. But William of Ockham was a 14th century religious monk. His argument wasn't the way he's been bastardized now. He was trying to use logic to justify divine miracles. His argument was that the simplest explanation is probably God, a divine miracle. Not that the simplest explanation from the data is correct. He must be turning in his grave.

## On Istanbul and the Call to Prayer

**David:** What do you get from spending time in Istanbul besides seeing your mom?

**Riva:** I learn about why countries should not be dysfunctional. Istanbul is incredible because it's where the East meets the West. It's half European, half Middle Eastern, Islamic and European. I cross my hotel in Europe to my mom's house on the Asian side every day by boat, literally crossing continents.

There's a lot of legacy and history there and you can't help but be humbled. Also to experience different faiths. I'm not Muslim. Some of my family members are Muslim. But to hear the **call to prayer** five times a day really stops me to pause and reflect. It dices up my days.

It reminds me of what it must have been like in the medieval period with the church bells. In an Islamic country like Turkey, hearing the five calls to prayer separates your day and causes you to reflect. It's just a beautiful place to visit. Not a beautiful place to live, because it gets frustrating, but the history there, the old Ottoman palaces, they spent what would be equivalent to a billion dollars. They were obsessed with detail. Definitely maximalists.

---

## Maximalism and the Expressive Soul

**David:** The obsession with detail, the maximalism. My favorite part of the editing process is looking at what I've written and trying to add vibrancy to individual words and sentences. I'm such a maximalist. For me the peak of writing and visual aesthetics is how do I make things maximalist while still retaining their coherence and elegance.

I'm always teetering on the edge of maximalism that sometimes gets confusing and messy. I'm always trying to find that balance. I feel like the expressive part of ourselves wants to show maximalism, wants to show the depths and contours of our personality. Minimalism is a suppression of all that.

**Riva:** If people want empirical evidence, just look at every expensive house for sale in Los Angeles right now. They look exactly the same. Look at the wealth of the past, like William Randolph Hearst. The Hearst Castle is insane! He wasn't even just a newspaper magnate. He collected antiques.

J.P. Morgan's library is my favorite place. Such a stunning homage to books. The balconies, the decoration, the color of the mahogany is gorgeous. People think of him as a banker, but if you go look at his library, he collected medieval manuscripts. He himself went on archaeological expeditions. He died on an archaeological dig.

These people in the past, when you read their diaries, they didn't just do one thing. They had varied interests because education wasn't so siloed. The great industrialists, the Hearsts, the J.P. Morgans, were very interesting characters interested in esoteric philosophy.

But now everyone just lives with very narrow views. I'm so inspired by the J.P. Morgans of this world. They cared about these things. They realized it was important to learn from the past.

## The Death of Spirit in Architecture

**David:** We went out to dinner last night, in downtown LA. About a 10 minute walk. It literally felt like a scene from *I Am Legend*. I felt like if we'd been there an hour later, we would have been murdered. No one on the streets. Totally dead.

The driver was like, "I cannot believe what has happened to this place."

He drops us off and there's this beautiful lobby, must have been built between 1920 and 1928. That Art Deco exterior, that Art Nouveau life and vibrancy to it, that detail. I just look at it like, wow, that is magnificent.

Then you look at the streets and the paint is chipped and there's no care to the outside. The juxtaposition between what was built 110 years ago and these decrepit, sad, lifeless streets. If that's not a motif for what's happening with the decline of the creative spirit, I don't know what is.

## Beauty, Meritocracy, and Why Everyone Hates Ayn Rand

**Riva:** The US has become hyper minimal, almost egalitarian aesthetically. It's embarrassing to be ostentatious or have any outburst of creativity. It's cringe to look like you care and try. You want to look like you don't care.

Balenciaga literally puts young people in trash bags and charges $900. The message is, "I'm rich and I don't care." That's weird. Look at the 90s. When we were dressing up, the supermodels they looked up to, there was a different kind of prestige, a meritocracy.

**Beauty is a natural superiority**, as Plato said. It plays to meritocracy. There are objective standards of beauty. When people go to the dentist, they all want more symmetrical teeth. There's symmetry, complexity, elegance. You can see mathematical elegance in a flower.

Now people disregard all of these things. "There's no such thing. We don't want to have superiority. Everything must be the same." This is what Nietzsche spoke so heavily about. This is his **Last Man** argument. The last man wants to be like everybody else. The madman is just trying to be individualistic.

That's why everyone hates Ayn Rand so much. Why do people hate Ayn Rand? She's a nice Russian woman whose argument is that people should be great, that people should look up to them, that they should be the models of society. Everyone's like, she's awful. And I'm like, what? You want to have shitty leaders? I think it's good that they have virtuous qualities.

This perverse view that any kind of meritocracy is bad works against our entire aspirations as humans and progress. There are natural hierarchies. Denying them is denying science. Some things are more beautiful than others. We should celebrate it. I don't care that I'm not the world's best painter, but I love going and seeing Monet's paintings. I'm not like, "damn that guy, stop painting." But now everyone has to be equal in this egalitarian world. There's no space for beauty.

## On Consciousness and Humility

**Riva:** Two of my family members have died, and around the time exactly when they died, I've had panic attacks. I've never had panic attacks. I'm not an anxious person. They died in Turkey at night in US time, and I woke up in the night and had a panic attack. The next morning, they told me my cousin died from a heart attack. I had thought I was having a heart attack.

As I've become more humble, I realize science doesn't have all the answers. In physics, 95 percent of all observable reality is just labeled as **dark matter** that we don't understand. Maybe we should be humble that we don't understand how things work.

I used to find all this spirituality energy stuff weird. I was like, I don't want to turn 30 and do the thing where everyone goes to ayahuasca and talks to a plant. But as you get older, if you're sensitive, you start to realize there are some things that aren't explanatory.

If you're sensitive, you start to notice there's magic. Not magic in the way people think of it, but serendipity and synchronicity. In that humility, I thought a lot about consciousness. In post-Enlightenment thinking, everyone was like, consciousness is firing neurons. Maybe consciousness is non-localized, everywhere, and we tap into it.

I've just become humble that I don't have the answer. I'm not saying I know what consciousness is. I'm just saying I'm not fully bought into the current paradigm, and questioning it is total heresy.

I tweeted once that I started to doubt materialism. Every AI engineer went, "Oh my gosh, look at this Silicon Valley VC who doesn't believe in consciousness." No, I'm just asking questions. We don't have proof of what consciousness is. To be that arrogant shows these dogmas. There's a certain post-Enlightenment dogmatic view of consciousness you're not allowed to question.

## The Arrogance of AI Research

**Riva:** This is also a problem with how people are building AI. They're like, we're just going to build this language calculator and it'll become conscious. You don't even know what consciousness means.

We don't have a definition of what the goal even is. We don't even know what intelligence is, that we're somehow going to get there. The arrogance in STEM to disregard the humanities. I've been thinking about these questions for a long period of time. It would save so much time if people were talking to each other.

A lot of the machine learning examples come from behaviorism. Looking at Pavlov's models, understanding reward functions. That was some of the beginning basis of machine learning. Then it separated out and became much more about code, not even looking at mimetic behaviors and intelligent animals.

How much is this divorce slowing down progress? This extreme arrogance between both camps. Everyone needs to take a massive humility pill.

## On Handwriting and the Somatic Experience of Writing

**David:** How do you think handwriting to the typewriter to the keyboard changes the shape of thought?

**Riva:** It divorces you from it. When you write with a pen, it becomes a somatic experience. Your handwriting is part of the art, how you do cursive, how you phrase your letters. Look at Islamic calligraphy, medieval manuscripts.

There was a formality. When I look at these old historical texts, including the New Testament manuscripts, how they display the words was part of the total whole of the writing. They wanted it to be beautiful.

Avicenna's *Canon of Medicine*, an 11th century medical textbook, has beautiful calligraphy. Imagine a medical textbook now having this. It was a formality of showing up.

Why does everyone in LA walk around in a sports bra? Nobody feels this respect to dress up and make an effort. We've lost the respect for formality. It's cringe to try.

I read everything on a Kindle sometimes, but they drive me mad. I feel divorced from the reading experience. Writing was meant to be an art form. How do we bring back beautiful books? Think about William Morris's edition of the Canterbury Tales, 19th century revival of medieval texts with beautiful calligraphy and drawing. Nobody respects it anymore. They want it as fast and quick as possible.

I want to go back to handwriting with a pen because I want to show up to it. When I type on a computer, it's divorcing me from the formality of my own thoughts.

Plus you can't delete it. A typewriter is great for this. When you write and edit, you get rid of things and lose sometimes things that were very good. It's like jazz. Jazz flows and then you roll with the mistakes.

**David:** When you're typing, the mistakes get deleted, and so you lose the mistakes. Sometimes the mistakes, you go back and realize they weren't mistakes. Creativity is sometimes recognizing the best mistakes you've made and building on them.

## The Dream of Many Lives

**Riva:** I dream of many different careers, many different lives, many different loves, many different renewals of myself. As if I was an immortal being who was able to experiment and explore across an endless timeline.

Everyone says you should live as if you'll die tomorrow. James Dean said, *"Live as if you'll die tomorrow. Dream as if you'll live forever."* Is it cooler to live as if you'll live forever?

If you tell yourself you have this pipeline of 85 years, you're like, well, I'm gonna have one career, one relationship. If you were immortal, you wouldn't have one job. You would probably do different things and experience stuff. I want to try all the flavors of life.

My first company was a toy store. So farfetched from what I've been doing the last 10 years, but it was probably some of the happiest years of my life. Kids came into this shop every day. We sold them toys, we taught them about entrepreneurship. I ran a philosophy class called **Petit Platos**.

**David:** Petit Platos? A philosophy school for kids?

**Riva:** We ran it in the back of our toy shop. Some of those kids are still my friends. There was one girl, Hermione, she's now studying philosophy and theology at university. She came to stay with me in America. She's like 21 now.

You don't realize until you try completely different fields and cultures the beauty and the things you can learn. I find it crazy that some people have just lived in the same place their entire lives.

I went back to my high school reunion and everyone was still dating each other. And I was like, wait, what? There's a whole world out there. How is it the chance that you all found the best people in this one moment of your life?

I want to experience it all. I want to live in Tokyo. I want to be a bus driver. I would love to be a criminal detective. Why not? Imagine just thinking about technology my entire life. I obviously love technology because technology is pragmatic philosophy. It takes philosophical questions and answers them.

But yeah, I want to do everything. That's why I care about longevity. I selfishly want more time to go do more fun things. People are having fun and life is so fun.

## What People Are Missing About Reading

**David:** What is it that you see in reading that other people are missing? When most people think of reading, they think it's boring. Meanwhile, you're like, my ideal vibe is sitting in a room with unlimited books.

**Riva:** People don't disregard books if they don't like them. Everyone's like, I don't really like this book but I guess I'll read it. Stop reading it. Maybe you're not buying the right books.

I don't know what my interests are from the start. I just start digging around, look over here and there, and I'm like, ooh, that sounds interesting. I told you I went to read the New Testament and ended up reading about New Testament manuscripts. That wasn't set out. I just followed my own curiosity.

People should just free flow. Don't read what your friends are telling you to read or what the New York Times bestseller is telling you to read. All the bestseller books are "how to be more productive." It's all nonfiction about how you're messed up and here's how to be less messed up. Which is a weird cultural thing that we all need to be fixed.

Go find things that resonate with you. Don't be embarrassed by it. I don't know many people who read Rilke. I gave copies of *Duino Elegies* to most of my friends. A lot of them were really grateful. They're like, you know what? I've never actually read poetry. Not as an adult. I was in school, and I really resonated with this.

Go try it. Go pick up a poetry book. You might be surprised.

## On Teaching Writing

**David:** Last question. If you were to design a curriculum about teaching writing, what wedge into writing education would you have?

**Riva:** People aren't studying the classical texts enough. I feel fortunate that I went to a very old school in England where we got taught Latin and Greek by default. We studied classical Roman texts. Here in America, you can maybe learn that if you pick it up.

If you read Euripides, the Odyssey, the Aeneid, the foundational books after the Bible, they did something similar to Ayn Rand. They took characteristics and qualities of what they think humans should be like, or not be like, and put them in characters.

You read Euripides, Shakespeare does the same thing. It's irrelevant in any era you read it. She loves him, he loves her, she's not being noble, treachery. Humans haven't changed. The context has changed, but human drives haven't. We still have the same drives; we just find different solutions.

Reading Euripides gives you humility. I'm not living in the greatest moment of human intellect. There are things for me to learn from the past. In that humility, I find my voice. It's a respect for that.

I just don't think people are reading old enough texts. Going back is seen as boring. But damn, that text has lasted for 2,000 years for a reason.

*That was a blast. Thank you.*

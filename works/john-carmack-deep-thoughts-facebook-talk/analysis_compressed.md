# John Carmack: Ideas & Engineering - Core Ideas (Compressed)

## The Idea Myth
- Ideas are vastly overvalued compared to execution
- "An idea is worth exactly one bottle of scotch" (Heinlein)
- The "lone inventor with brilliant idea" narrative is mostly false
- Most "unique ideas" are either obvious to insiders, fatally flawed, or incoherent
- A good project = hundreds/thousands of good decisions, not one eureka moment

## How to Think About Ideas
- Deliberately try to break your own ideas early - make it a game
- "Pet ideas" are dangerous - untested ideas calcify into defended beliefs
- Devaluing ideas psychologically helps you generate more of them
- Be antifragile: enjoy the high of new ideas, but don't be damaged when they fail
- "Ride the idea high at the beginning, but it's a puzzle to figure out how to bust it"

## Where Ideas Come From
- Ideas come from "working in the mud" on real problems
- Creativity can be farmed - don't wait passively for inspiration
- Expose yourself to diverse stimuli while keeping your current problem in mind
- Old ideas resurface in new contexts years/decades later
- Build prototypes, not patents - physical artifacts beat theoretical claims

## The 4x Rule
- Improvements need to be ~4x to meaningfully matter
- Marginal gains often don't justify the complexity
- Focus on substantial wins, not incremental optimization

## On Learning & Craft
- Math takes time - even Carmack didn't fully understand graphics math for a decade
- Young engineers underestimate how deeply good engineers care (bordering on obsession)
- "Sometimes the best way to be really smart is to figure out why you don't have to be really smart" (stupid tricks > elegant complexity)
- Pragmatism over purity when shipping

## Tactical Insights
- Test ideas by "working from outside in" until you find what busts them
- Iterate through multiple approaches - first attempts usually fail
- Latency/resources can be "spent" when buying something more valuable
- Have many ideas - need a dozen before one is great
- More ideas than time to explore them is the ideal state

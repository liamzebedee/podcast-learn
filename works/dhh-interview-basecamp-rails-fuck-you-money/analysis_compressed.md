# Core Ideas: DHH Interview (Compressed)

## The F*ck You Money Attitude
- The attitude precedes the money—adopt it before you have anything to show
- DHH had a slide that said "Fuck You" in 2004 before Rails had users
- Pursue the best ideas you know how without getting discouraged
- Mild-mannered people don't suddenly become bold after getting rich—it's the other way around

## Side Projects & Low-Risk Entrepreneurship
- Basecamp was built on 10-15 hours/week while DHH was a student earning $15/hour
- Consulting provides stable income while side projects create wealth
- Zero risk: no external capital, no mortgage at stake
- Modern tools (AI, cheap computing) make this even more achievable now
- Don't defer living—people who postpone dreams forget them

## The 2% Philosophy
- 2% of people take the stairs when an escalator is available
- 2% put the shopping cart back when no one's looking
- Do multiple 2% actions and you become the 0.1%
- "It's so easy to be great. No one wants to do even the bare minimum" (Goggins)
- Out of 1,000 job applicants, maybe 5 actually stand out
- Give genuine, non-transactional gifts—they create unexpected magic

## Authenticity & Enthusiasm
- "Content creator" is a deplorable term—it commodifies creative work
- No one loves "content"—they love writing, programming, building
- The only marketing that works: genuine transfer of enthusiasm
- Humans are exceptional at smelling inauthenticity
- Being genuine requires vulnerability—criticism hits the real you
- Documentation-driven development: writing about a feature reveals its flaws

## Stoicism & Resilience
- "It's not that kind of planet"—expect summer, fall, AND winter
- Platitudes are wisdom's end state—they're repeated because they're true
- Antifragile made "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" actually sink in
- Wisdom requires readiness—the right insight at the wrong time bounces off
- The internet pendulum: you'll go from darling to villain if you're online long enough
- Prepare for storms before they come

## EU vs US
- Europe is "desperately, catastrophically, pathetically behind" in entrepreneurship
- When Europeans talk about glory, they look backward; Americans look forward
- Copenhagen: best for families; America: best for ambitious 20-somethings
- Tall poppy syndrome (Janteloven) discourages celebrating success
- Cultural change takes decades to generations, not regulatory reform

## Luck, DNA & Success
- 80-90% of who you are is pre-programmed (visible in DHH's three sons)
- The learnable 10-20%: speaking, writing, habits, discipline
- 93% of money's utility = not worrying about rent/groceries ("petite wealthy")
- Basecamp is a disproportionate outlier—20 years of other products didn't replicate it
- Even without Basecamp, DHH would be "petite wealthy" from consulting + smaller SaaS

## Nation Building
- Entrepreneurs confuse company success with nation-building capability
- Every 20th-century attempt to redesign a country became murderous
- Culture cannot be written down—it's honed over generations
- Chesterton's Fence: don't remove traditions until you understand why they exist
- The EU has failed systematically over 40-50 years of trying to reshape member states

## The Framework (One Sentence Each)

1. **Attitude first** → Money follows the mindset, not vice versa
2. **10-15 hrs/week** → Side projects built Basecamp with zero risk
3. **2% compounds** → Small consistent actions separate the exceptional
4. **Transfer enthusiasm** → Genuine passion beats manufactured content
5. **Expect winter** → Prepare for hardship before it arrives
6. **Petite wealthy** → 93% utility at a fraction of "three comma club"
7. **DNA ≠ destiny** → 10-20% is learnable through practice
8. **Don't redesign nations** → Culture takes centuries, not clever ideas

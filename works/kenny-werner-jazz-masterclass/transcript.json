something","start":347.319,"duration":4.401},{"text":"for that I I'm not an expert on therapy","start":348.96,"duration":5.0},{"text":"but I tell you there's another way where","start":351.72,"duration":5.0},{"text":"you just focus on something else other","start":353.96,"duration":3.88},{"text":"than your","start":356.72,"duration":3.4},{"text":"mind and when it happens it happens","start":357.84,"duration":4.44},{"text":"immediately happens all at once and","start":360.12,"duration":4.6},{"text":"suddenly like wow I'm just playing cuz","start":362.28,"duration":5.68},{"text":"my hands are playing you know and that's","start":364.72,"duration":5.319},{"text":"always exactly the right stuff in

but","start":371.8,"duration":5.239},{"text":"it's not in performance now just knowing","start":374.599,"duration":4.281},{"text":"that is not enough you need to have a","start":377.039,"duration":4.241},{"text":"practice so that eventually the trigger","start":378.88,"duration":4.0},{"text":"of playing the instrument well I was","start":381.28,"duration":3.88},{"text":"about to describe the uh the sequence","start":382.88,"duration":3.36},{"text":"first you learn how to touch your","start":385.16,"duration":2.96},{"text":"instrument without thinking or I don't","start":386.24,"duration":3.76},{"text":"know if it's a singer here making a","start":388.12,"duration":3.96},{"text":"sound without thinking making a sound","start":390.0,"duration":5.56},{"text":"without thinking is this a jazz sound or","start":392.08,"duration":6.76},{"text":"is this the right sound or is it pretty","start":395.56,"duration":6.32},{"text":"enough or you know what I mean that that","start":398.84,"duration":4.84},{"text":"the rough thing about school is you're","start":401.88,"duration":4.0},{"text":"trying to educate yourself and it's","start":403.68,"duration":4.88},{"text":"awfully hard not to fall in the hole of","start":405.88,"duration":5.719},{"text":"always criticizing yourself education","start":408.56,"duration":5.84},{"text":"stimulates criticism and how to keep","start":411.599,"duration":4.841},{"text":"learning without falling in a hole of","start":414.4,"duration":4.84},{"text":"self-criticism so deep that you know you","start":416.44,"duration":6.08},{"text":"can't do anything anymore you know and","start":419.24,"duration":5.799},{"text":"so this is a practice of hearing a","start":422.52,"duration":5.32},{"text":"sound not just accepting it but even","start":425.039,"duration":5.961},{"text":"aggressively loving it now in the","start":427.84,"duration":7.12},{"text":"beginning it's like you have to fake it","start":431.0,"duration":5.44},{"text":"because you hear a sound and you just","start":434.96,"duration":6.799},{"text":"don't love it so from not not becoming","start":436.44,"duration":7.439},{"text":"to becoming you have to fake it in other","start":441.759,"duration":3.681},{"text":"words if I do","start":443.879,"duration":3.921},{"text":"this then before I have a chance to","start":445.44,"duration":4.879},{"text":"think I go ah","start":447.8,"duration":4.799},{"text":"Ah that's the most beautiful sound I","start":450.319,"duration":4.401},{"text":"ever heard isn't that you know in other","start":452.599,"duration":4.401},{"text":"words I convince myself I don't want to","start":454.72,"duration":4.24},{"text":"wait and","start":457.0,"duration":4.44},{"text":"do you know can you feel what I was","start":458.96,"duration":5.84},{"text":"doing evaluating this sound no I want to","start":461.44,"duration":7.199},{"text":"jam that frequency by wow it actually","start":464.8,"duration":5.2},{"text":"doesn't sound","start":468.639,"duration":3.761},{"text":"beautiful see what happens I thought so","start":470.0,"duration":5.159},{"text":"anyway what happens is what you're","start":472.4,"duration":5.919},{"text":"aiming for happens after you affirm it","start":475.159,"duration":4.6},{"text":"if you're waiting for proof that you","start":478.319,"duration":3.641},{"text":"sound good then it's like a dog chasing","start":479.759,"duration":4.961},{"text":"its tail you never quite get there so","start":481.96,"duration":4.72},{"text":"what you do is you affirm that what","start":484.72,"duration":4.599},{"text":"you're playing is beautiful and it","start":486.68,"duration":4.68},{"text":"becomes","start":489.319,"duration":5.241},{"text":"beautiful because as you accept","start":491.36,"duration":7.32},{"text":"it it starts to Glow with your own","start":494.56,"duration":6.039},{"text":"acceptance so I would actually meet that","start":498.68,"duration":4.32},{"text":"this is one of the practices learning to","start":500.599,"duration":4.361},{"text":"touch the instrument without thinking","start":503.0,"duration":3.759},{"text":"then learning to love every sound that","start":504.96,"duration":3.84},{"text":"comes out of the instrument then you go","start":506.759,"duration":4.84},{"text":"to gigs and it's uneven because you","start":508.8,"duration":5.44},{"text":"can't ignore your attachments to that","start":511.599,"duration":4.92},{"text":"gig you know you want to sound good you","start":514.24,"duration":4.12},{"text":"want the rest of the band to like you","start":516.519,"duration":3.481},{"text":"you want the club owner to give you the","start":518.36,"duration":3.479},{"text":"gig again you want hopefully a record","start":520.0,"duration":3.68},{"text":"producer to like you you hope there's a","start":521.839,"duration":3.601},{"text":"Critic there and he's writing good","start":523.68,"duration":5.76},{"text":"things which he never is there he","start":525.44,"duration":5.24},{"text":"occasionally writes good things but he's","start":529.44,"duration":4.8},{"text":"never actually there you know um so","start":530.68,"duration":5.44},{"text":"these things are attachments which make","start":534.24,"duration":3.48},{"text":"it difficult to let go like you were","start":536.12,"duration":4.04},{"text":"letting go just in these practices","start":537.72,"duration":5.2},{"text":"but as you keep practicing letting go of","start":540.16,"duration":5.72},{"text":"your thoughts becomes less difficult to","start":542.92,"duration":7.28},{"text":"do and more natural eventually you set","start":545.88,"duration":6.6},{"text":"up a program in your mind where to touch","start":550.2,"duration":5.28},{"text":"your instrument is to let go when you","start":552.48,"duration":4.84},{"text":"touch your instrument you go into a","start":555.48,"duration":4.799},{"text":"mental balance that you don't even own","start":557.32,"duration":5.199},{"text":"the rest of the day that can be","start":560.279,"duration":4.56},{"text":"programmed I mean the the good news is","start":562.519,"duration":4.241},{"text":"that that can be programmed as you","start":564.839,"duration":4.601},{"text":"program that the inconsistencies in your","start":566.76,"duration":4.72},{"text":"performance will","start":569.44,"duration":4.48},{"text":"disappear see because you're looking for","start":571.48,"duration":3.88},{"text":"something to happen on the gig but the","start":573.92,"duration":3.76},{"text":"prep the mental preparation for that has","start":575.36,"duration":5.64},{"text":"to happen way off the","start":577.68,"duration":5.44},{"text":"gig you understand what I'm saying does","start":581.0,"duration":3.12},{"text":"that answer it or do you have a","start":583.12,"duration":3.08},{"text":"follow-up question from","start":584.12,"duration":5.6},{"text":"that yeah that consistency has to be","start":586.2,"duration":5.759},{"text":"practiced and it's practiced not by","start":589.72,"duration":3.52},{"text":"hoping that you're going to play","start":591.959,"duration":3.081},{"text":"something better but by loving","start":593.24,"duration":3.719},{"text":"everything you play now that naturally","start":595.04,"duration":3.52},{"text":"brings up the question well then how do","start":596.959,"duration":3.32},{"text":"you get better because you're going to","start":598.56,"duration":3.04},{"text":"love everything you play right don't you","start":600.279,"duration":4.281},{"text":"need to be unsatisfied you don't need to","start":601.6,"duration":5.76},{"text":"be unsatisfied in order to be motivated","start":604.56,"duration":6.24},{"text":"to go on go go beyond that because there","start":607.36,"duration":6.64},{"text":"are two functions in the brain you know","start":610.8,"duration":4.56},{"text":"there's the left brain and the right","start":614.0,"duration":4.92},{"text":"brain and I think the left brain is the","start":615.36,"duration":6.36},{"text":"more um intellectual you know the side","start":618.92,"duration":4.76},{"text":"that takes care of","start":621.72,"duration":4.92},{"text":"business

that","start":634.0,"duration":6.399},{"text":"which you do not know or that which you","start":637.76,"duration":6.12},{"text":"haven't gotten control of yet and that's","start":640.399,"duration":6.041},{"text":"it efficient practicing means only","start":643.88,"duration":4.199},{"text":"dealing with things that you're not","start":646.44,"duration":3.76},{"text":"comfortable with yet not sitting there","start":648.079,"duration":5.32},{"text":"and playing for an hour why sometimes","start":650.2,"duration":5.36},{"text":"does a practice session start as a","start":653.399,"duration":4.521},{"text":"practice session and involves into just","start":655.56,"duration":4.8},{"text":"playing doesn't that happen often you","start":657.92,"duration":4.52},{"text":"start with a specific idea but in a","start":660.36,"duration":3.4},{"text":"minute you're just playing does that","start":662.44,"duration":2.48},{"text":"ever happen to","start":663.76,"duration":4.48},{"text":"you does it ever

that","start":675.56,"duration":4.399},{"text":"specific thing gets diluted you start to","start":677.079,"duration":5.081},{"text":"cover more stuff as you're practicing","start":679.959,"duration":3.44},{"text":"and eventually you just start playing","start":682.16,"duration":2.84},{"text":"Tunes you just start playing them over","start":683.399,"duration":4.0},{"text":"and over again the problem with that is","start":685.0,"duration":4.36},{"text":"in real time you can never get to

# Kenny Werner Jazz Masterclass: Core Ideas Compressed

## The Zone & Performance

- The zone is created by **not criticizing yourself** during performance
- Performance is about **not being careful** - your safety net is internal
- Self-criticism breaks the groove; your reaction to notes disrupts flow
- Practice **loving every sound aggressively** before you have time to evaluate
- "Carnegie Hall, Carnegie Deli—doesn't matter" - cultivate healthy detachment
- Care deeply off-stage; be indifferent on-stage
- Personal power of the musician makes notes right (Monk example)

## The Paradox of Caring

- When you desperately want to play well, you play worse
- When you don't care, it flows
- Peak experiences fade because **excitement about the experience breaks it**
- Don't notice how you sound; notice how it **feels**
- Walk off stage as if the performance never happened

## Practice vs. Playing

- **Practicing**: Study of what you don't yet control (left brain, analytical)
- **Playing**: Carte blanche acceptance of everything (right brain, flow)
- These modes must never contaminate each other
- Efficient practice means **only working on what you're uncomfortable with**
- The "20 variations method": isolate problem spots, find 20 good ways through

## The Toothbrush Analogy

- Practice with the **detachment and consistency** of brushing teeth
- Don't evaluate progress during practice
- It doesn't take talent to upgrade—it takes **patience**
- Consistent daily practice without emotional investment in results

## When Practice Is Complete

- When the formerly difficult passage requires **no more mental effort** than easy parts
- "Don't quit a day before the miracle happens"
- Unaddressed weaknesses plague you for life—they don't improve with age

## Mind Sabotage

- The mind constantly generates criticism: "should be more burning/modern/authentic"
- Two flows disrupted: flow of playing AND flow of practicing
- Impatience breaks the practice groove
- "Grandiose statements" like "I'll never get this" don't help and aren't true

## The Ego's Role

- Ego pushes you beyond competence during performance
- Creates "disease state of mind": anything easy can't be worth much
- Links self-worth to playing quality (unhealthy)
- Makes honest self-assessment emotionally painful

## Self-Assessment Without Pain

- View weaknesses as **inventory**, not proof of inadequacy
- "Whatever my worst gig is—that's how I play"
- If you mess up form, you haven't mastered form (simple diagnosis)
- Separating self-worth from ability enables honest assessment

## False Limiting Beliefs

- "I can't swing—I'm Danish" / "I'm a woman in a man's world" - all false
- Every limitation comes from presumptions that aren't true
- People who don't listen to these thoughts go far

## Foundational Skills for Improvisers

- Rhythm
- Time
- Linear manifestations of chord changes
- When these are effortless, you can play anything put in front of you

## The Five-Minute Rule

- "Practice for 2 hours" = you don't practice (waiting for time to appear)
- "Practice for 5 minutes" = you practice a lot (often becomes 45 min)
- **Five minutes is always your way in**
- Many small opportunities beat waiting for perfect conditions

## Transformation: Process vs. Instantaneous

- Breaking into consciousness is **instantaneous**
- Learning to access it at will is **the process**
- The practice: stay in that state longer and longer until it becomes who you are

## From Thinking to Feeling to Sensuality

- Beyond the thinking mind lies emotional connection
- Beyond emotion lies **physical, embodied pleasure** in playing
- Greatest singers revel in the sensuality of sound production

## Teaching Philosophy

- Traditional education often prevents the "real experience of music"
- **Establish joy of playing first**, then technique
- The teacher's job: embody and radiate love of the subject
- More important to share excitement than to teach content
- "Freedom to" (mastery enables) > "Freedom from" (escape)

## Authenticity & Success

- Performance must come from within **comfort zone** (controlled material)
- Your voice emerges only on material you're deeply familiar with
- **Record what you know, not what you're working on**
- Phrasing is extension of personal identity—don't deny your background
- "Your strength is in what's really happening with you, not who you'd like to be"

## Going Deeper Into Who You Are

- Everyone has everything inside them
- Become special by going deeper into your specificity
- "The secret of great spirits is how deeply they love what they're doing"
- The universal resides within the particular

## Carmen McRae Example

- Presence, control, complete mastery of material
- "Her presence was a concert"
- Higher goal: transformation, not demonstration

## The Path Summarized

1. **Thinking → Feeling → Sensuality**
2. **Criticism → Acceptance → Love**
3. **Effort → Effortlessness → Presence**

## Master Quote

> "That is the closest thing to Enlightenment in music—loving absolutely every sound you make, no matter where it is."
